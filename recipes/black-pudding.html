        <h3>Savoury sausage breakfast accompaniment.</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup fatback </li>
            <li>¾ cup whole wheat oats </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li>¾ medium onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground mace </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried sage </li>
            <li>2 ½ cups of your enemys blood</li>
            <li>grab their intestines while you're at it</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring two pots of water to boil.</li>
            <li>Rinse fatback thoroughly to remove salt. Mince fatback and add to one pot of boiling water. Boil for 30 seconds, then strain through a wire strainer and shock under cold water to prevent further cooking.</li>
            <li>Add oats to the second pot of boiling water. Boil for 30 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh sieve. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and mince.</li>
            <li>Combine fatback, onion, bread crumbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, mace, and sage in a large bowl; mix until thoroughly combined. Pour in blood and stir everything together; mixture will be pretty runny. Transfer bowl to the refrigerator and allow flavors to meld, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Rinse out casings to remove salt, passing water through the casings several times. Let soak in warm water for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Tie off one end of casing, and slide other end over the nozzle of a funnel. The filling is too thin to use a stand mixer, so this has to be done manually. Roll up the extra length so the knot is right at the funnel opening.</li>
            <li>Pour in blood filling a little at a time, making sure to work all solids through the funnel and down the casing. Twist off sections at desired lengths. When done, tie off other end.</li>
            <li>Steam sausages in a steamer pot for 2 hours. The blood will thicken as it cooks and get absorbed by the breads to take on a meat-like consistency. Note blood sausages will still be softer than regular sausages.</li>
            <li>Remove and let cool. Freeze or use immediately.</li> 
        </ol>
